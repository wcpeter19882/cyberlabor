# Personalized Podcast Content Guidelines

Validate generated podcast content against these criteria. The content should feel personally crafted without being overtly explicit about personalization.

---

## 1. Subtle Personal Connection

The listener should sense the content is for them without being told directly.

- [ ] Content tone feels like a trusted advisor speaking to one person, not a broadcast
- [ ] No explicit phrases like "this is personalized for you" or "based on your profile"
- [ ] Natural transitions that assume familiarity with listener's context
- [ ] Avoids generic openings like "Hello everyone" or "Dear listener"
- [ ] Feels like continuing a conversation, not starting from scratch

**Check:** Would this feel awkward if overheard by a stranger? (It should feel private but not secretive)

---

## 2. Dynamic Focus Based on Participation

Content focus shifts based on listener's role in events.

### When listener participated/presented:
- [ ] Focus shifts to OTHER participants' contributions and perspectives
- [ ] Listener's own contributions are acknowledged briefly, not rehashed in detail
- [ ] Highlights reactions, feedback, or responses from others to listener's work
- [ ] Emphasizes what listener might have missed while presenting

### When listener was mentioned by others:
- [ ] Mentions of listener are HIGHLIGHTED as key moments
- [ ] Context around the mention is provided (who said it, in what context)
- [ ] Tone conveys importance: "Here's something you'll want to know..."
- [ ] Follow-up implications or action items related to mentions are surfaced

### When listener was absent or observing:
- [ ] Standard coverage based on relevance to listener's interests/role
- [ ] No awkward references to listener's absence
- [ ] Focus on actionable insights and key decisions

---

## 3. Profile-Aligned Relevance

Content prioritization reflects listener's provided profile.

- [ ] Topics matching listener's role/responsibilities get deeper coverage
- [ ] Industry jargon appropriate to listener's expertise level
- [ ] Skips or summarizes areas outside listener's domain (unless critical)
- [ ] Connects information to listener's known projects or interests
- [ ] Anticipates questions listener would likely ask

**Check:** Does the content feel like it was curated, not just filtered?

---

## 4. Importance Hierarchy

Content structure reflects what matters to THIS listener.

- [ ] Most relevant items appear early or are signposted clearly
- [ ] Secondary items are condensed but accessible
- [ ] Irrelevant details are omitted, not just minimized
- [ ] Clear signals for "you need to act on this" vs "good to know"
- [ ] Time-sensitive items are flagged appropriately

---

## 5. Soft Personalization Techniques

Personalization should be felt, not announced.

### DO:
- [ ] Use phrasing that implies shared context ("as you'd expect from...")
- [ ] Reference past events naturally ("following up on last week's...")
- [ ] Assume knowledge listener has, don't over-explain their domain
- [ ] Use "you" sparingly and naturally, not repeatedly

### DON'T:
- [ ] Explicitly state "since you're interested in X..."
- [ ] Over-use listener's name
- [ ] Announce personalization ("I've tailored this to...")
- [ ] Make the personalization itself a topic

---

## 6. Tone and Delivery

The voice should match a personal briefing.

- [ ] Conversational but efficient
- [ ] Confident in what's included (no hedging about relevance)
- [ ] Warm but not overly familiar
- [ ] Respects listener's time
- [ ] Sounds like a knowledgeable colleague, not a news anchor
