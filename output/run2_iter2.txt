Profile: I am Chao Wang. I am a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I am reachable at wangchao@microsoft.com. I am operating at a senior research-to-production tier, aligning with strategic leadership and technical execution across engineering. I collaborate closely with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I focus on translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research initiatives into product engineering cycles. I have expertise in applied science for production systems, AI-assisted developer workflows, and cross-functional engineering execution, so I don’t need foundational explanations in those areas.
Description: Action-oriented catch-up on what changed after Chao’s AI prompt session, plus the most actionable takeaways from RTC migration tooling (Package Modernizer/OS Porter) and the agent-driven PR review tool roadmap.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026—your AI prompt slides triggered two concrete follow-ups: a request to go deeper on the “counterintuitive” techniques next Friday, and a standing concern that prompt setups can drift across model upgrades, so the group wants a repeatable maintenance loop rather than a one-off prompt artifact.
Andrew: One reaction worth flagging: the team latched onto the “double-check” pattern—generate a broad pass, then force a re-check—as a practical way to raise confidence without over-constraining the prompt, and they want to connect that to multi-sampling habits in reviews and bug bash workflows.

Ava: On the RTC signaling tooling track, Package Modernizer is being positioned less as “one giant migration PR” and more as a staged workflow—there was explicit push to break migrations into modular steps with code review checkpoints to avoid context bloat and keep agent output tighter.
Andrew: The other notable outcome: the migration flow is settling on repo-level dependency-graph ordering, with explicit design proposals up front and to-dos emitted for the parts that still need humans—so teams should expect “buildable code plus a punch list,” not a fully hands-off port.

Ava: OS Porter’s next inflection point is the inner-loop automation—local build, unit tests, sandbox validation with iterative AI fixes—because today it’s strong on build-error remediation but still leaves validation and deployment heavy lifting outside the tool.
Andrew: There was a clear request for an extensibility hook after that inner loop finishes—basically “let teams run their own rollout/rollback scripts”—and the OS Porter owners sounded open to exploring it once inner loop ships.

Ava: The Agent Engineering learning series landed a very practical artifact: a PR review tool that builds a worktree, pulls PR/work-item context from multiple sources, then runs preset review modes and can push results back into DevOps comments or a walkthrough doc.
Andrew: The sharpest workflow implication is auto-fix as separate commits—small, revertable, auditable—and the group is already steering it toward an extension model so teams can plug in their own checks and automations without forking the whole thing.

Ava: If you want one clean “what to do next” thread: for your SOX-adjacent bug bash cadence, the team is converging on repeatable review loops—modular task lists, checkpointed diffs, and a second-pass re-check—so your next session can standardize that as the default operating pattern rather than an ad hoc trick.
Andrew: Your forward look: next Friday is queued for the deeper dive on counterintuitive prompting, and the most leverage will come from turning the drift concern into a lightweight maintenance playbook the group can run whenever the underlying model or tooling changes.
