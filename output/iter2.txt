Profile: I am Chao Wang. I am a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I am reachable at wangchao@microsoft.com. I am operating at a senior research-to-production tier, aligning with Strategic Leadership and Technical Execution across engineering. I collaborate with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I am focused on translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research-heavy initiatives with product-driven engineering cycles. I have expertise in applied science, research-to-production execution, and cross-functional technical leadership, so I don’t need foundational explanations in these areas.
Description: Action-oriented takeaways across SOX-adjacent AI workflow discussion plus two engineering tool updates: .NET/package modernization, Windows-to-Linux migration automation, and agentic PR review acceleration.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: Package Modernizer is being used at real scale now—SS3 Data Platform reported 8 projects, OSI Runtime 20—and it’s actively in-flight on PSTN Admin and Control Plan moving from .NET Framework to .NET Core.
Andrew: The key operational detail: the migration agent runs repo-level, then migrates project-by-project based on dependency and API graphs; it generates design proposals per project, including explicit functionality-gap callouts and to-do items when it can’t safely complete something.
Ava: One concrete process improvement landed in Q&A: break migrations into modular mini-steps with code review after each step to reduce context bloat; the owner acknowledged the point and plans to split big PRs into smaller commits.
Andrew: Adoption/access is straightforward—teams can install the VS Code extension directly—but the organizer explicitly encouraged reaching out for support if a team wants help beyond the baseline workflow.
Ava: OS Porter’s current value proposition is measurable: one platform team cited 7 PRs on a service and about 28% lower dev+validation effort; their internal breakdown says it covers about 70% of roughly 50 migration tasks, but today it’s mainly fixing build errors.
Andrew: OS Porter’s pipeline is staged—assessment, code generation, then a not-yet-released “inner loop” to automate local builds, unit tests, and sandbox validation with iterative fixes. That inner loop is the near-term focus.
Ava: The most actionable extension idea came from the automation angle: add a simple script hook after the inner loop so teams can plug in their own rollout/rollback or extra validations—potentially via ADO APIs. The OS Porter team didn’t commit, but they signaled openness once inner loop ships.

Andrew: In the SOX weekly meeting, your AI slides triggered follow-up questions specifically around the sampling/distribution diagram—people pressed on what the axes mean and whether the “ideal” region implies outputs outside the model’s natural capacity; net outcome was alignment that the visualization needs careful framing, and it’s a topic to continue refining.
Ava: The group also converged on a practical tension: “counterintuitive” prompting can be powerful, but iterative refinement can overfit and become brittle—especially across model upgrades—so the operating guidance coming out of the room was to iterate for speed early, then deliberately generalize prompts back down.
Andrew: Next-step commitment from the room: there’s another session planned next Friday to go deeper on the counterintuitive techniques and the open questions that didn’t fit.

Ava: Separate from SOX, the Agent Engineering learning series showed a PR review tool that’s pushing hard on end-to-end review throughput: it builds a work tree for context, pulls in work-item and meeting/design artifacts, then runs review presets like bug-hunt, performance, or security, with outputs as ADO comments, a generated walkthrough, or terminal diffs.
Andrew: The practical “velocity control” mechanism: it can parse review comments and apply trivial fixes as separate commits, with optional human approval before committing; reviewers get transparency and easy rollback.
Ava: Integration questions were addressed: it runs in its own terminal to avoid IDE file locks, and it supports different backends (Copilot CLI or cloud) depending on what the user chooses.
Andrew: The forward-looking thread: plans include expanding beyond PR review into build/deploy automation and incident analysis, plus an extension model so teams can bolt on custom functionality—potentially even agent-generated plugins.

Ava: If you want one concrete follow-up to push this week: ask the OS Porter owners whether they’ll accept a minimal “post-inner-loop hook” proposal as a pilot, because that’s the smallest change with the biggest workflow leverage.
