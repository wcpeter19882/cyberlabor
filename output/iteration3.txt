Description: Action-oriented catch-up across SOX/RTC: concrete tool takeaways from Package Modernizer and OS Porter, plus the key follow-ups and extension ideas raised around automation hooks and AI-centric PR review workflows.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: Package Modernizer landed as “repo-level, dependency-graph-driven migration,” and the sharpest pushback was about PR size and agent context limits—Kiran pressed for modular task lists and smaller reviewable steps, and Wei committed to splitting big PRs into smaller commits.
Andrew: On incompatibilities, the notable outcome was confirmation that the flow is design-first: it proposes options, flags functionality gaps explicitly, and leaves human to-dos when it can’t safely close the loop—conditional compilation and missing policies were called out as the kinds of leftovers.
Ava: Adoption signal: beyond .NET Framework to .NET Core work, the component-upgrade/governance-alert path is already producing volume—hundreds of PRs created and 100+ merged—so this is drifting from “demo tool” to “operational lever” inside SS3.
Andrew: Access is straightforward—teams can install the VS Code extension directly—but the practical next step is to engage Wei’s team if a service wants hands-on support rather than self-serve experimentation.

Ava: OS Porter’s headline: Windows-to-Linux migration is being structured as categorized tasks, with current strength on build-error fixing; Xiao Chen’s team reported measurable effort reduction and about 70% coverage across a 50-task migration checklist, but with limits outside build fixes.
Andrew: The most actionable thread was automation extensibility—Kiran asked for rollout/rollback automation beyond the upcoming inner-loop, basically “give teams a script hook.” Yifan and Yanan didn’t commit to delivery dates, but they were open to async hook capability once inner-loop ships.
Ava: Near-term watch item: inner-loop is the next big feature—automated local builds, unit tests, sandbox validation with iterative AI passes—intended to collapse turnaround time. If that lands cleanly, the hook idea becomes the obvious next pressure point.

Andrew: SOX RTC weekly: since you were the presenter, the only delta that matters is what others challenged and what they want next.
Andrew: Gavin and Jun kept drilling on the graph’s axes and what “ideal” versus “model-native” output implies; the practical outcome is the team wants clearer, more operational framing so people don’t confuse “targeted sampling” with “making things up.”
Ava: Ming’s follow-up angle was tooling: he pushed on versioning and rollback and also on escaping single-model lock-in—net is appetite for a CLI-style workflow that can swap models without rewriting the whole prompt pipeline.
Andrew: Wenlong explicitly asked for a deeper follow-up session on the counterintuitive prompt techniques, and the group aligned to schedule next Friday to finish the remaining open questions.

Ava: Agent Engineering learning series: Kiran’s PR review tool is moving from concept to “shareable artifact”—he said he’ll publish a binary plus source for community contributions.
Andrew: The real leverage points people reacted to were context packaging and reversible automation: work-tree creation to bound tokens, pulling Work IQ/work items for grounding, and applying trivial fixes as separate commits so teams can revert cleanly.
Ava: The extension-model request came up directly—Tyler asked for plug-in style extensibility, and Kiran said the backend is designed for it, with a future direction where agents could generate plugins on demand; that’s the thread to track if you care about scaling this across teams with different review standards.

Andrew: Closing: three follow-ups to keep warm—smaller-step PR slicing for Package Modernizer, script-hook automation after OS Porter’s inner-loop, and next Friday’s SOX session to turn the prompt techniques into something repeatable for the team.
