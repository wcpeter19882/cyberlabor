Profile: I am Chao Wang. I am a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I am reachable at wangchao@microsoft.com. I am operating at a senior research-to-production tier, aligning with Strategic Leadership and driving Technical Execution with engineering managers and software engineers. I collaborate with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I focus on translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research-heavy initiatives with product-driven engineering cycles. I have expertise in applied science for production systems, cross-functional technical leadership, and turning research methods into engineering practice, so I don’t need foundational explanations in these areas.
Description: Action-oriented catch-up across SOX/RTC and agent-engineering: concrete follow-ups from the AI prompt session, plus migration-tool and PR-review-tool next steps and open integration asks.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Andrew: SOX RTC AI session: the room converged on two follow-ups—go deeper on “counterintuitive” prompting, and keep the content anchored in repeatable workflow patterns instead of one-off tricks.
Ava: Next Friday was the agreed slot for the continuation; the explicit ask was more detail and more examples on the counterintuitive techniques, plus time for open Q&A.
Andrew: Tooling direction that drew interest: model-agnostic, CLI-first workflows with versioning and rollback checkpoints; the friction called out was being locked to a single model inside existing IDE tools.
Ava: Process feedback that stuck: “double-check” loops—generate an initial comprehensive pass, then run a second pass to prune and validate—was framed as a practical way to boost confidence without overfitting prompts.

Andrew: RTC Signaling Services tech talk—Package Modernizer: Kiran pushed for smaller, modular task steps and code reviews per step to avoid context bloat and giant PRs; Wei Feng acknowledged and said they plan to split large PRs into smaller commits.
Ava: Ali clarified access: teams can install the VS Code extension directly, but the recommendation was to engage the team for support when running real migrations.
Andrew: OS Porter: Kiran’s biggest integration ask was a simple script hook after the inner loop—so teams can plug in rollout/rollback and custom validations (ADO API, deployment scripts) without the OS Porter team building bespoke automation.
Ava: Response from Yifan and Yanan: inner loop completion stays the priority, but they were open to exploring asynchronous hook capabilities once inner loop lands.

Andrew: Agent Engineering learning series—Kiran’s PR review tool: the strongest signal was “context packaging” as the differentiator—pulling PR diffs plus adjacent code, plus Work IQ and work item context, while managing token limits by forking only what’s needed.
Ava: Workflow impact: the tool can auto-apply trivial fixes as separate commits with SHAs, keeping reversibility and auditability; discussion leaned toward mechanisms like deep links and “ready for review” detection to cope with faster change velocity.
Andrew: Extensibility landed as a theme: Tyler asked for an extension model; Kiran said the backend is designed for it and floated agent-generated plugins as a future direction.
Ava: Next deliverable: Kiran said he will share a binary and the source repo for community contributions; the implied next step for interested teams is to pilot on a real PR stream and feed back on presets, accuracy, and integration friction.

Andrew: Action items to track: lock the SOX follow-up agenda for next Friday around counterintuitive prompting and repeatable workflows; for OS Porter, capture the script-hook requirement as a concrete proposal; for the PR tool, watch for the repo drop and identify one candidate service to pilot end-to-end.
Ava: That’s the full delta across the three meetings—what changed, what people asked for, and what’s queued up next.
