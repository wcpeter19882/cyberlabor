Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier. My responsibilities involve aligning with strategic leadership and core engineering teams. My collaborators include Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I specialize in translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridge research initiatives with product-driven engineering cycles. I am deeply familiar with applied science, AI-enabled development, and prompt engineering, and I work closely with engineering and strategic leaders—no need for foundational explanations in these areas.

Description: Today's briefing cuts directly to reactions and outcomes from code review automation, AI-driven prompt management, and migration tooling, emphasizing SOX and action-oriented team follow-ups.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: Feedback from the team on your AI prompt slide deck focused on clarifying model output distributions and how best to leverage counterintuitive prompt techniques. The discussion raised ongoing concerns about prompt drift and model upgrades, leading to agreement to revisit these methods in a follow-up session next week.
Andrew: The team pressed for more actionable ways to extract model common sense and integrate restore checkpoints into their workflows, underscoring the need for flexible, model-agnostic tooling. Interest remains high in spec-driven development and more robust task tracking.
Ava: In the Agent Engineering session, one participant showcased a PR review tool that bundles context from code, meeting notes, and work items, with auto-fix capabilities and iterative review processes. Suggestions from the group included expanding automation to build and deploy pipelines, integrating incident analysis bots, and enabling plugin extensibility for workflow acceleration.
Andrew: The team emphasized that future updates should allow agents to generate plugins and deep links for fast code review readiness, aiming to keep manual review central but accelerate cross-cutting processes.
Ava: On code migration, teams reported that Package Modernizer and OS Porter are now supporting dozens of projects. The discussion centered on agent granularity, modular PR commits, and automation hooks for deployment, with active pilots demonstrating measurable reductions in manual effort for Windows-to-Linux transitions.
Andrew: Key blockers flagged include functionality gaps after migration and the need for more extensible automation hooks in OS Porter. The group remains focused on iterative improvement and increasing team adoption with human-in-the-loop validation.
Ava: That’s the core team feedback and next actions for today’s sessions.
