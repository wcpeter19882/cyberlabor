Profile: I am Chao Wang. I am a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I am reachable at wangchao@microsoft.com. I am operating at a senior research-to-production tier, aligning with strategic leadership and technical execution across engineering. I collaborate closely with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I am focused on translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research initiatives into product engineering cycles. I have expertise in applied science-to-engineering translation, cross-functional technical alignment, and productionizing research into product-driven development.

Description: Action-oriented catch-up across SOX/RTC and adjacent engineering threads, focusing on what others asked for, what changed, and the concrete follow-ups coming out of the sessions.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: From the SOX RTC bug bash: the only concrete follow-up is a continuation—there’s appetite to go deeper on the “counterintuitive” prompt techniques, and the group penciled in next Friday to finish the remaining questions.
Andrew: The most pointed pushback in that room was around the “ideal distribution” framing—questions focused on whether the target region implies outputs beyond the model’s natural support, and the team wanted tighter axis definitions so people don’t misread the picture as “making things up.”
Ava: There was also a practical concern about prompt durability: model upgrades can drift behavior, so the implicit ask is to treat prompts like living artifacts—iterate, but don’t overfit them into brittle, overly-specific instruction blobs.

Andrew: On spec-driven workflow: the discussion gravitated to versioning and rollback—interest in checkpoint-style restores at user-story boundaries, plus a desire to avoid being locked to a single model provider in tooling.
Ava: Net effect: if this becomes a team practice, the bar is “reproducible task lists + rollback points,” not just clever prompting.

Andrew: Tech Talk—Package Modernizer and OS Porter: the most actionable feedback was about execution shape, not the tools’ existence.
Andrew: For Package Modernizer, the request was to reduce context bloat by breaking migrations into modular mini-steps with code review after each step, instead of giant PRs; the owner acknowledged that and said they plan to split large PRs into smaller commits.
Ava: For OS Porter, the ask was an extensibility hook: after the upcoming inner-loop feature lands, teams want a simple script-hook mechanism so they can bolt on their own rollout/rollback and extra validations—potentially via ADO APIs—without the OS Porter team having to build bespoke integrations.

Andrew: Agent Engineering learning series: the PR review tool demo landed as “context is the product.”
Andrew: The tool’s approach—building a work tree, pulling Work IQ notes, work items, and PR metadata—got validated in Q&A as the way to keep reviews accurate without blowing token limits.
Ava: Two integration asks surfaced: avoid local IDE file-lock conflicts by keeping the tool isolated in its own terminal workflow, and add an extension model so teams can append their own review modes and automation without forking the project.
Andrew: Next step from that session: the binary and source are supposed to get published for contributions, with longer-range plans pointing at build/deploy automation and incident investigation workflows.

Ava: If you only do one thing before next Friday’s SOX RTC slot: tighten the “graph” framing into something people can’t misinterpret, and decide what the group should standardize—prompt patterns, spec templates, or both—so the follow-up isn’t another free-form debate.
