Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier. I work directly with Strategic Leadership and core Engineering Managers, including collaborators Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. My expertise covers applied science, bridging research and scalable engineering, and I am deeply familiar with AI, prompt engineering, team workflows, and technical product migration. No explanation is needed for SOX processes, AI prompt techniques, code review automation, or agent-driven engineering.

Description: Action-driven updates on your AI prompt workflow session, engineering automation advances, and cross-team migration tooling, highlighting follow-up questions, outcomes, and team-driven next steps.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026. The team dug into your new AI prompt deck, sparking discussion on how intuitive and counterintuitive prompt techniques are shifting. One participant pressed for clarity on model output distributions and sampling points, leading to your breakdown of the graph axes. Your code review approach—letting the model adopt standards and then fine-tune via blacklist—triggered questions about tapping common sense and avoiding prompt drift, with the team flagging the risk of overfitting through excessive iteration.

Ava: You introduced the spec-driven workflow, integrating prompt templates, scripts, and structured task management, which drew interest around automated version rollback and restoration. The team compared your tooling to GitHub Copilot and asked about decoupling prompt workflows from locked language models, with future sessions scheduled to explore these counterintuitive methods in detail.

Andrew: On engineering automation, the agent-driven PR review tool was demoed, showing how context is gathered from work trees and work items, and how the tool’s review presets and auto-fix features accelerate code reviews. The group focused on extension models and backend design for future plugin generation, with several suggesting mechanisms to handle velocity and deep linking in review workflows.

Ava: Migration tooling updates centered on the Package Modernizer and OS Porter VS Code extensions. The presenter laid out how migration agents work at the repo level, trigger modular code reviews, and generate design proposals with explicit to-dos. The team discussed breaking large PRs into smaller commits and enhancing automation hooks for rollout and validation, especially in cross-platform service migrations.

Andrew: You’ll want to watch for next week’s follow-up where counterintuitive prompt strategies and automation hooks get a deeper dive. Your team’s interest in extensible review and migration workflows is leading to concrete next steps on tool enhancement and AI-driven automation.
