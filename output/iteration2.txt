Description: Action-forward takeaways across RTC migration tooling and SOX/agent-engineering workflows, emphasizing follow-ups, automation hooks, and what needs doing next.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: Package Modernizer is getting pushed toward smaller, reviewable increments: Kiran pressed for modular task lists and stepwise code reviews to reduce agent context bloat, and Wei agreed—expect the team to move away from giant PRs toward smaller commits.
Andrew: Migration agent scope got clarified: repository-level planning via dependency graphs, then project-by-project execution; the practical implication is teams should prepare repos so work can be sliced cleanly along project boundaries.
Ava: Incompatibility handling is explicitly in-scope: Sainath asked if the agent deals with incompatibilities, and the answer was yes—design proposals include conditional compilation and known gaps, with explicit to-dos when parity isn’t achievable automatically.
Andrew: If anyone wants to trial Package Modernizer beyond the current pilots, the path is: install the VS Code extension directly, but Wei’s strong preference is to engage the team for support—especially for component governance alert cleanup where they’re already at “hundreds of PRs” scale.
Ava: OS Porter’s measurable win: Xiao’s team reported 7 PRs on a real service migration and estimated ~28% effort reduction; coverage is roughly 70% of identified migration tasks, but right now it’s mainly fixing build errors, not end-to-end validation.
Andrew: OS Porter is lining up an “inner loop” feature—automated local build, unit test, sandbox validation with iterative AI fixes. That’s the near-term delivery focus.
Ava: The most actionable product idea came from Kiran: add a simple post–inner-loop script hook so teams can plug in rollout/rollback and extra validations—ADO API, custom deployment scripts, whatever. Yifan and Yanan didn’t commit, but they signaled openness once inner loop lands.
Andrew: Adoption signal: about 30 active users and 50+ services supported, with pilots touching Defender, Substrate, and Sydney Services—so expect more asks for standardized hooks and extensibility as usage broadens.

Ava: In the SOX RTC bug bash meeting, the only delta that matters is what others asked for next: Gavin and Jun kept pushing for tighter clarity on the sampling graph’s axes and what “ideal” vs “overly spiky” output really means, so the follow-up need is a cleaner, shared visual explanation the group can reuse.
Andrew: Ming and Wenlong steered the next session request: more depth on the “counterintuitive” prompt techniques, plus how to keep prompts from overfitting as people iterate. Next Friday is the implied checkpoint.
Ava: Tooling interest surfaced too—Ming explicitly wants a workflow that isn’t locked to a single model and has rollback/versioning ergonomics. That’s a concrete requirement signal for any internal CLI-style prompt/spec toolchain.

Andrew: Agent Engineering learning series stayed very execution-focused: Kiran’s PR review tool is already bundling context from PR diffs plus Work IQ, work items, and meeting/design notes, then running preset review modes like bug-hunt, perf, and security.
Ava: The operational detail people cared about was context accuracy under token limits: Sainath asked how it avoids hallucinated context, and Kiran’s answer was “fork only what’s needed into a work tree” and pull from multiple authoritative sources, not just the PR description.
Andrew: The workflow change that will matter to teams: the tool can turn review comments into separate, trivial-fix commits with SHAs—so revertability is built in, and the review stream stays auditable.
Ava: Two integration asks to watch: Tyler pushed for an extension model so teams can add custom functionality; Kiran said the backend is designed for extensibility and floated “agents generate plugins on demand” as a direction. Separately, Andrew and Renato raised workflow scaling problems—deep links, auto “ready for review” detection—because PR velocity goes up when review is cheap.
Andrew: Near-term next step from Kiran: he plans to share a binary and the source repo for contributions. If this is going to land broadly, someone will need to own onboarding docs, security posture, and a minimal contribution guide so it doesn’t stall at “cool demo.”

Ava: Action stack to carry forward: push migration tools toward smaller PR slices and explicit human-review checkpoints; prioritize OS Porter inner loop, then evaluate a lightweight script hook; and for the PR review tool, decide who pilots it on a real SOX-owned repo and feeds back on auditability, rollout friction, and extension needs.
Andrew: Next calendar pressure: next Friday’s SOX session—expect it to center on prompt technique drift, model-change resilience, and a more reusable explanation artifact for the sampling/axes debate.
