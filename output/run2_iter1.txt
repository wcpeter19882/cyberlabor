Profile: I am Chao Wang. I am a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I am wangchao@microsoft.com. I am operating at a senior research-to-production tier, aligning with strategic leadership and driving technical execution with principal engineering managers and core engineers. I am a close collaborator with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I am focused on translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research-heavy initiatives into product engineering cycles. I have expertise in applied science-to-engineering translation, AI-assisted development workflows, and cross-functional technical leadership, so I don’t need foundational explanations in those areas.
Description: Action-oriented catch-up across SOX/RTC AI workflow discussions plus tooling updates on repo-scale migration and AI-centric PR review automation, focusing on concrete follow-ups and what to operationalize next.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: In your SOX RTC bug bash session, the only real “delta” was the pushback and probing: questions centered on whether the “ideal” sampling region implies outputs beyond the model’s native distribution, and repeated asks to pin down what the axes mean in a way people can reason about without hand-waving.
Andrew: The follow-up pressure point: prompt iteration. The group converged on the risk that iterative refinement can overfit into brittle, snippet-like instructions, and there was explicit interest in a deeper next session on the counterintuitive techniques—already penciled for next Friday.
Ava: One operational thread that landed: spec-driven workflow as the way to keep prompt templates, scripts, task lists, and checkpoints from drifting; the open question was versioning and rollback ergonomics, with the practical expectation being “restore points per user story” rather than one giant undo.
Andrew: If you want a clean next step before Friday: turn the open questions into a short decision list—what “axes” explanation is acceptable, what the team should standardize on for prompt maintenance, and what the minimum viable spec-kit structure is for your SOX workflows—so the meeting doesn’t re-litigate definitions.

Andrew: On repo-scale modernization, Package Modernizer is being positioned as “buildable code first, humans validate,” with the team acknowledging that large, monolithic PRs are a drag.
Ava: The strongest actionable feedback from the room: break migrations into modular mini-steps with reviews after each step to reduce context bloat and improve agent reliability; they explicitly agreed to move toward smaller commits and tighter PR slices.

Ava: On Windows-to-Linux migration, OS Porter is getting real adoption signals—dozens of active users and many services in flight—but the limiting factor is still that it mostly drives build-error fixes today.
Andrew: The near-term product bet is the “inner loop” automation—local build, unit test, sandbox validation with iterative AI passes—because that’s where cycle time collapses.
Ava: The most concrete extension request was a simple hook model after inner-loop completion—teams want a scriptable path into rollout/rollback and custom validations, without the tool having to own everyone’s deployment logic.

Andrew: In the agent engineering learning series, the PR review tool demo was all about compressing review time by pulling context automatically—work items, notes, PR description, and a scoped worktree—so the model sees the “why,” not just the diff.
Ava: The workflow detail that matters: it can post review output back into ADO, generate a walkthrough to guide a reviewer through the change logically, and apply trivial fixes as separate commits so reversions stay clean.
Andrew: The questions that surfaced were practical integration ones—token/context management, which execution backend to use, and avoiding local IDE file locks—and those were answered with “scoped worktree, selectable backend, separate terminal.”

Ava: The forward-looking thread: people want extensibility—an extension model, deep links, and automation like “ready for review” detection—because the whole point is velocity without losing auditability.
Andrew: Your most actionable move from all three meetings is to pick one place to operationalize: either adopt the mini-step PR slicing pattern for migrations, or pilot a hook-based inner-loop-to-rollout bridge, or standardize your SOX spec-driven prompt workflow—then assign an owner and a deadline so it doesn’t stay a good idea.
