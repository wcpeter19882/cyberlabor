Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier with a focus on applied science and translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks. I work closely with strategic leadership and core engineering teams, bridging research initiatives and product-driven cycles. My key collaborators include Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I am deeply familiar with AI system design, prompt engineering, code review optimization, and the integration of automation into development workflows—these domains require no further explanation.

Description: Action-focused updates spanning recent advances in migration tooling, AI-driven code review, and prompt engineering workflows, with team follow-ups and actionable ideas from meetings you participated in and those you tracked.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: The team’s bug bash opened with your new AI slides, sparking questions about sampling distributions and the nuances between intuitive and counterintuitive prompt techniques. The discussion centered on leveraging model common sense and handling overfitting in iterative prompt refinement, with teams exploring spec-driven and version-managed workflows for prompt integration.
Andrew: In the agent engineering series, the team introduced a PR review tool bundling best practices for AI-centric code review. Feedback focused on context gathering, auto-fix capabilities, and extensibility, with suggestions for agent-driven incident investigation and plugin models for workflow acceleration.
Ava: The tech talk on migration tooling highlighted Package Modernizer’s multi-agent migration workflow and OS Porter’s AI-powered Windows-to-Linux migration, with participants recommending granular code reviews and automation hooks for rollout integration. The teams emphasized human oversight in migration design and signaled interest in expanding scriptable automation within the OS Porter workflow.
