Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier where I bridge strategic leadership and technical execution. I work closely with collaborators Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. My expertise lies in applied science, specifically in translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and integrating cross-functional initiatives between research and product engineering. I am deeply familiar with SOX, agent-driven workflow automation, AI-centric code review, migration tooling, and prompt engineering in large-scale environments—so explanations of these domains are not needed.

Description: Today’s topics include reactions to your AI prompt methodology, team feedback on spec-driven development and agent automation, and actionable insights from code review tool adoption—plus the latest migration tool improvements and team-driven workflow updates.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: In your SOX RTC meeting, the team engaged with your new AI slides and discussed how counterintuitive prompt techniques are reshaping code review workflows—there was interest in refining these methods further, and Wenlong Yang proposed a follow-up session to continue exploring prompt strategies.
Andrew: One participant raised concerns about overfitting during iterative prompt refinement, and the group agreed that frequent revision is necessary to keep prompts general and effective, especially as models evolve.
Ava: The spec-driven workflow you introduced drew attention, with the team discussing how integrating prompt templates and scripts into MVP user stories streamlines automated task management and version control.
Andrew: Feedback focused on practical integration with dev tools, and there was particular interest in decoupling the workflow from fixed language models to enable greater flexibility.
Ava: In the Agent Engineering session, the team demonstrated the latest PR review tool, highlighting automated context gathering, code walkthrough generation, and extensibility for custom review presets; feedback centered on improving review speed while maintaining manual oversight.
Andrew: The discussion also covered future enhancements, like agent-driven incident analysis and plugin generation, with the team emphasizing the need for seamless integration into existing workflows.
Ava: From the Tech Talk, the team showcased the Package Modernizer and OS Porter migration tools, sharing how multi-agent design and automation are advancing migration from .NET Framework and Windows to .NET Core and Linux, with human-in-the-loop validation remaining critical.
Andrew: Team feedback suggested splitting large pull requests into smaller commits for better code review and agent performance, and there was enthusiasm for adding automation hooks and script extensibility to further streamline deployment and migration cycles.
Ava: You’ll want to note that next steps include piloting OS Porter’s inner loop automation and scheduling follow-ups on prompt strategies, as the team continues to push for workflow efficiency and actionable improvements.
