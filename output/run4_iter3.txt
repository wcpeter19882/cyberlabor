Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior tier that interfaces with strategic leadership and principal-level engineering. I am deeply engaged in bridging advanced research with large-scale engineering, and my key collaborators include Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I specialize in converting scientific theory to scalable frameworks and influencing both research and product engineering. Given my expertise in applied science, AI, prompt engineering, and cross-functional technical alignment, I do not need explanations of foundational concepts in these domains.

Description: This episode focuses on actionable insights and reactions from recent deep-dive sessions on AI prompt techniques, migration automation, and agent-centric code review—highlighting next steps, tool evolution, and what’s worth watching for your SOX and engineering priorities.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026. Your AI slides for SOX RTC Bug Bash got plenty of engagement; the team drilled into your sampling distribution graph and asked about how “ideal outputs” relate to model common sense. There’s clear interest in further exploring counterintuitive prompt methods in next week’s session, especially around iterative prompt refinement and spec-driven task management.

Ava: You’re getting direct questions about leveraging model expertise—how to extract and utilize internal standards for code and prompt design. The group’s feedback signals the need for agile adjustment as models evolve, and the team is keen to double down on prompt iteration techniques, with Wenlong specifically calling for a follow-up.

Andrew: On the tool integration front, the conversation shifted to practicalities—restore checkpoints, versioning, and decoupling prompt workflows from specific models. The group’s appetite for a command-line tool that sidesteps lock-in was unmistakable; expect this to resurface in future sessions.

Ava: Over in the agent engineering series, the team demoed a PR review tool bundling best practices for AI-driven code review. The tool’s auto-fix and walkthrough features are expanding, with discussion focused on integrating context from multiple sources and managing token limits. Next steps include pilot deployment and extending automation to incident analysis and log investigation.

Andrew: For migration automation, the Tech Talk session revealed new momentum behind Package Modernizer and OS Porter. The team is piloting modular migration processes and AI-assisted code transformation, with active feedback on agent granularity and task breakdown. The “inner loop” feature in OS Porter stands out—automation and script hooks are on the horizon, and teams are pushing for broader rollout.

Ava: Your SOX priorities intersect here—component upgrades and migration governance are seeing wider internal adoption. Both tools are generating actionable to-do lists and human review checkpoints to ensure robust transition from .NET and Windows to Linux. Worth watching: the pace at which inner loop automation and script extensibility land in production.

Andrew: That’s your signal for this week. Expect new questions on prompt iteration, tool extensibility, and migration automation in the next round—your feedback loop is driving the agenda.
