Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier. I work in close alignment with Strategic Leadership and core engineering teams and collaborate with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. My functional focus is Applied Science, specializing in translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research initiatives with product-driven engineering. I have deep expertise in AI, prompt engineering, code review automation, and agent-driven workflows, and do not require explanations of foundational concepts in these domains.

Description: This episode prioritizes action-oriented outcomes and team reactions to Chao Wang's AI slide deck and workflow contributions, alongside high-impact updates on migration tooling and agent-driven code review, with explicit next steps and tool adoption insights.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: Team feedback on your AI slide deck centered on practical deployment, with questions about sampling distributions and model “common sense” leading to a discussion on balancing intuitive versus counterintuitive prompt techniques.
Andrew: The team raised concerns about prompt drift and overfitting during iterative refinement, and the session concluded with agreement to explore counterintuitive prompt methods further in a follow-up meeting next Friday.
Ava: During the Tech Talk session, the team demonstrated migration tools—Package Modernizer and OS Porter—with a focus on automating .NET and Windows-to-Linux transitions. Q&A emphasized agent granularity, task breakdowns, and plans to enhance automation hooks for rollout and validation.
Andrew: The Agent Engineering series showcased a PR review tool that streamlines AI-assisted code review by integrating context from multiple sources and supporting auto-fix, walkthrough generation, and extensible review presets. Team discussion highlighted future expansion into deployment, incident analysis, and plugin models.
Ava: Community contributions were encouraged, with next steps including binary distribution and continued improvements based on team feedback.
