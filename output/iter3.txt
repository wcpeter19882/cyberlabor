Description: Action-oriented catch-up across SOX/RTC updates: concrete follow-ups from the AI prompt session you led, plus high-signal takeaways and next steps from the RTC migration tooling tech talk and the agent-driven PR review tooling series.

Ava: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Andrew: In the SOX RTC bug bash meeting where you were the speaker, the only concrete outcome was a follow-up session next Friday, driven by interest in going deeper on the “counterintuitive” prompting thread.
Ava: Two asks landed during Q&A: a request to make the sampling graph axes interpretation more concrete, and a concern about prompt drift across model upgrades—both tee up as agenda items rather than resolved decisions.
Andrew: There was also a tooling direction question—decoupling prompt workflows from a single model and having rollback/versioning that feels more like a CLI-first workflow—no commitment, but it’s now explicitly on the table for next time.

Ava: On RTC migration tooling, Package Modernizer is being positioned as “buildable code first, humans validate,” and the practical pressure point was PR size and agent context bloat.
Andrew: The strongest process suggestion was to break migrations into a modular task list with mini-steps and do code review after each step; the response was alignment, plus an intent to split large PRs into smaller, focused commits.
Ava: The other operational detail that matters: the migration agent is operating at repo-level planning, then project-by-project execution based on dependency graphs, with design options surfaced for humans to pick from when there are tradeoffs or functionality gaps.

Andrew: Adoption signals were the headline: SS3 Data Platform and OSI Runtime have already pushed multiple projects through it, and the component-upgrade mode is generating lots of PR throughput—enough that support and onboarding, not capability, becomes the likely limiter.
Ava: Access is straightforward—teams can install the VS Code extension directly—but the implied next step is to engage the owning team if you want help tuning the workflow or handling edge cases.

Andrew: OS Porter’s current value is concentrated in accelerating Windows-to-Linux migrations by organizing issues into concrete task buckets—Windows-only dependencies, telemetry gaps, incompatible libraries, artifact migration—then generating code changes where it can.
Ava: The near-term bet is the “inner loop” automation: local builds, unit tests, sandbox validations, and iterative fixes—still pending release, but it’s the lever that reduces turnaround time the most.

Andrew: The most actionable product feedback in Q&A was about extensibility: a simple script hook after the inner loop—rollout/rollback, extra validations, ADO-driven automation—framed as a low-effort, high-impact add.
Ava: The team didn’t commit, but they did explicitly park it as “after inner loop,” with openness to asynchronous hooks.

Andrew: On agent engineering and PR review, the Stas Doc tool is effectively trying to solve the “review is the bottleneck” problem by pulling structured context—PR diffs plus referenced code, work items, and meeting/design notes—without blowing token limits.
Ava: Review output is designed to be consumed where engineers already live: ADO comments, a generated walkthrough, or terminal diff views, and it supports presets like bug-hunt, performance, security, plus shareable custom presets.

Andrew: Two workflow decisions stand out: it can apply trivial fixes automatically as separate commits, and it treats reversibility as a first-class constraint—separate SHAs for transparency and easy rollback.
Ava: Open questions that stayed open: how far to push automation beyond review into build/deploy and incident analysis, and what the extension model looks like when users want to bolt on their own capabilities.

Andrew: If you want one tight set of next actions coming out of all three meetings: lock the agenda for next Friday’s SOX RTC session around drift-proof prompting plus model-decoupled workflows, and separately push for “script hook after inner loop” as the smallest OS Porter change with the biggest downstream automation payoff.
Ava: And if this needs to land with your usual stakeholders, the framing is simple: smaller-step tasklists and reversible commits are the common pattern—migration, prompting workflows, and PR review are all converging on the same operational shape.
