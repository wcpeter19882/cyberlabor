Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier with direct alignment to Strategic Leadership and Principal Engineering Managers. My key collaborators include Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. I specialize in translating scientific theory into scalable engineering frameworks and bridging research-heavy initiatives with product-driven engineering cycles. My expertise covers applied science, AI, software engineering, prompt engineering, agent-driven workflows, and SOX-related processes; I do not require foundational explanations in these domains.

Description: This episode cuts straight to the latest in AI-driven code review, prompt engineering strategies, agent automation, and migration tooling—focusing on outcomes, actionable insights, and what you need to know about cross-team adoption and tool enhancements.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: The team’s recent SOX meeting put your new AI slide deck front and center—your approach to sampling distributions, prompt techniques, and spec-driven development drew direct questions about model common sense and iterative prompt tuning. You’ll want to note the team’s interest in counterintuitive prompt methods, with Wenlong aiming to dig deeper in the next session.
Andrew: After your introduction, the team’s discussion on spec-driven workflows and tool integration surfaced practical pain points—restore checkpoints and model decoupling came up, with requests for more flexibility in the workflow. Expect follow-ups around prompt maintenance and the risk of overfitting as your tools evolve.
Ava: Over in the Agent Engineering series, the team walked through the PR review tool’s capabilities—automated context gathering, multiple review presets, and AI-powered fixes. The discussion highlighted future plans for pipeline automation and plugin extensibility, with team feedback steering next-stage enhancements.
Andrew: On the migration front, the Tech Talk session showcased Package Modernizer and OS Porter. The team emphasized practical challenges—migration agent granularity, code review integration, and human-in-the-loop validation. New automation hooks and rollout scripts for OS Porter are in play, with interest from several service teams in expanding adoption.
Ava: Your SOX action items and prompt engineering strategies remain at the core. Next up, look for specific team requests around automation, inner loop validation, and further counterintuitive prompt deep dives—your expertise is driving the agenda.
