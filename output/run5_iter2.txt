Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at a senior research-to-production tier with direct alignment to strategic leadership and technical execution. I work closely with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. My expertise centers on applied science—translating theoretical advances into practical, scalable engineering solutions. I bridge research initiatives with product-driven engineering, focusing on SOX compliance and action-oriented workflows. I am deeply familiar with AI model development, prompt engineering, agent-based migration tools, and code review automation, so no foundational explanations are necessary for these topics.

Description: This episode covers reactions to your AI-driven prompt engineering session, new team feedback on migration automation, and actionable updates from agent-centric code review tools—emphasizing next steps, peer input, and follow-up items relevant to SOX and applied science workflows.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Ava: The latest SOX RTC team session saw strong engagement with your AI prompt engineering slides. The group pressed for clarity on the graph axes and debated approaches for tapping into common sense criteria in code reviews. One participant raised concerns about model drift with prompt upgrades, prompting a discussion on iterative adjustment and spec-driven workflows.
Andrew: Feedback around spec-driven development focused on maintaining version checkpoints and integrating with existing dev tools—your process for restoring story checkpoints and decoupling language models drew interest from the team. Several attendees expressed interest in exploring counterintuitive prompt techniques further, with a follow-up session scheduled for next week.
Ava: Over in the Tech Talk on RTC signaling, the discussion on Package Modernizer and OS Porter centered on practical automation. Questions from the group led to plans for more modular migration steps, smaller PRs, and supporting asynchronous rollout scripts for Linux migration. The team flagged the importance of human validation alongside automated fixes, and shared actionable suggestions for extending tool capabilities.
Andrew: On the agent engineering front, the team responded to new PR review tooling with requests for deeper integration and extensibility. Several colleagues proposed enhancements like agent-driven incident analysis, plugin generation, and improved context gathering from meeting artifacts. The presenter committed to sharing binaries and source for community feedback, with a focus on accelerating cross-cutting review processes without bypassing manual oversight.
Ava: You’ll want to note the upcoming session on advanced prompt strategies, and the team’s momentum on migration automation and agent workflows—each area is moving toward practical deployment, with input from your collaborators shaping the next wave of improvements.
