Profile: I am Chao Wang, Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft, operating at the senior research-to-production tier and aligned closely with strategic leadership and core engineering teams. I collaborate regularly with Ramesh R, Qiongfang Zhang, Bingqian Shen, Bo Lu, Yu Jin, Meng Zhou, and Wanqin Cao. My expertise spans applied science, bridging research and scalable engineering, and I am well-versed in advanced AI, prompt engineering, code review automation, and workflow optimization. I do not require explanations of foundational concepts in these domains.

Description: Coverage centers on actionable developments in AI-enabled migration tooling, code review automation, and advanced prompt workflows, with emphasis on outcomes, team feedback, and next-step integrations discussed in recent meetings.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026. The latest round of tech sessions brought direct updates on migration automation. You’ll see Package Modernizer pushing deeper into .NET Core upgrades—teams are using its multi-agent design for dependency analysis, generating focused migration proposals with highlighted functionality gaps. The team flagged that human review remains essential, especially when conditional compilation or missing policies surface.

Ava: OS Porter’s adoption is accelerating: more Windows-to-Linux migrations, with about 30 active users supporting 50-plus services. The team demoed how the tool scans for Windows-specific code, flags telemetry gaps, and auto-generates refactoring with conditional logic. The new “inner loop” feature is in final stages—AI-powered builds and sandbox validations will soon cut manual effort. You’ll want to note the team’s openness to script hooks for custom rollout automation as a highlight from the Q&A.

Andrew: Your SOX team meeting introduced new AI-driven slides and graph sampling concepts. The discussion dug into prompt engineering: moving away from rule-based prompts towards leveraging model common sense and counterintuitive methods. Your explanation of spec-driven workflows and checkpointed version control drew interest for integrating with existing development tools.

Ava: One participant spotlighted prompt iteration risks—overfitting and drift—while the group explored double-check mechanisms for code reviews. The consensus: maintain generality in prompts and refine them iteratively to keep outputs robust across model upgrades. The team agreed to a follow-up session targeting advanced prompt techniques.

Andrew: In agent engineering, teams shared hands-on feedback on the PR review tool. The tool’s multi-source context gathering, review presets, and auto-fix features were demonstrated—teams valued the transparency of auto-commits and self-review loops for markdown outputs. There’s momentum for plugin extensibility, incident analysis, and deeper integration with existing pipelines.

Ava: The engineering group flagged a need for better context management and seamless tool integration with local dev environments. The roadmap includes a bundled binary release and ongoing improvements based on team feedback, focusing on accelerating review velocity while preserving manual oversight.

Andrew: That’s your cross-team update—actionable shifts in automation and workflow, evolving prompt strategies, and new tooling integrations shaping the next cycle.
