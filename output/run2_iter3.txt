I am expert in applied science for production systems, cross-functional technical alignment, and research-to-engineering execution.

Description: Action-oriented catch-up across SOX/RTC AI workflow discussions plus two adjacent agent-tooling talks: migration automation (Package Modernizer/OS Porter) and AI-centric PR review tooling, with the concrete follow-ups and next-session hooks called out.

Andrew: Hi Chao, today is Wednesday, February 4, 2026.
Andrew: Your AI slide deck triggered two immediate follow-ups: people wanted tighter definitions on the graph axes and what “ideal” sampling means, and they also flagged the risk that “too narrow” prompting turns outputs robotic.
Ava: One practical next step coming out of that: the group wants a deeper, dedicated session on the “counterintuitive” prompt techniques—already pointed at next Friday—so the open items are to carry forward the unresolved questions on axis interpretation, and how to keep prompts stable across model upgrades without drifting.
Andrew: The other thread that landed well was the spec-driven workflow angle—there was interest in how versioning and rollback actually behave in practice, especially compared to being locked into a single model inside existing tools.
Ava: The concrete ask that emerged: show the checkpoint/restore flow end-to-end and how it maps to user stories and task lists, so teams can judge whether it fits their SOX-style change control expectations.

Andrew: Separate meeting, but it rhymes with your theme: an internal PR review tool demoed an AI-centric review workflow that pulls PR context from work items and prior discussion notes, then outputs review comments, walkthroughs, and even auto-fix commits.
Ava: The “why it matters” delta: it’s explicitly trying to solve the non-coding time sink—reviewing, validating, and iterating—by controlling context size and splitting trivial fixes into reversible commits.
Andrew: Two follow-ups to watch there: requests for an extension model so teams can bolt on their own checks, and discussion about downstream workflow pressure—deep links, “ready for review” detection, and handling higher PR velocity without breaking review quality.

Ava: On the RTC signaling services tech talk: two migration accelerators are getting traction—one focused on .NET/package modernization with an agent-driven design-and-migrate loop, and another focused on Windows-to-Linux service migration with task categorization and code generation.
Andrew: The sharpest actionable idea from the Q&A was modularizing the work: smaller steps, smaller PRs, and code review checkpoints to reduce agent context bloat and make rollbacks safer.
Ava: For the Windows-to-Linux tool, the near-term feature that people are waiting on is the “inner loop” automation—local build and test iteration—plus an explicit request to add script hooks so teams can plug in their own rollout/rollback or extra validations.

Andrew: If you only do one thing before next Friday: capture the unanswered questions that came up live—graph axis semantics, “ideal distribution” boundaries, and prompt drift across model upgrades—so the follow-up session can spend time on decisions, not re-deriving definitions.
Ava: And if you want a quick bridge to the other two meetings: your task-list framing is the common denominator—both the PR review tooling and the migration tooling are converging on “smaller units of work, explicit checkpoints, and human-in-the-loop validation,” which is exactly where your next set of examples will land best.
